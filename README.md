# Gender Pay Gap Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and visualizations for analyzing the gender pay gap using the General Social Survey (GSS) wages dataset. The analysis is conducted in R, and various visualizations are created to explore the relationship between income, gender, education, work status, marital status, number of children, and age.

## Data Source

The dataset used for analysis is sourced from the GSS wages dataset, available through the stevedata package in R. The dataset includes information on survey year, income, age, occupation, occupational prestige score, number of children, work status, gender, education level, and marital status.

## Visualizations

1. **Time Trends in Gender Pay Gap**: Point chart showing how the average income has changed over the survey years for both genders.

2. **Income Across Different Education Levels for Each Gender**: Line plot illustrating the average income distribution across education levels for males and females.

3. **Income Across Different Work Statuses for Each Gender**: Line plot displaying the average income distribution across work statuses for males and females.

4. **Income Across Different Marital Statuses for Each Gender**: Line plot depicting the average income distribution across marital statuses for males and females.

5. **Income by Gender Based on Number of Children**: Kernel density plots showcasing the log-transformed income density distribution based on the number of children for both genders.

6. **Income Across Different Age Categories by Gender**: Kernel density plots illustrating the log-transformed income density distribution based on custom age groups for males and females.

7. **Percentage of Males and Females at Different Salary Ranges**: Line plot with points and text labels showing the percentage distribution of males and females in different salary ranges.

## Instructions

1. Install required R packages: `stevedata`, and `tidyverse`.
2. Load the GSS wages dataset and clean the data.
3. Run R scripts for various analyses and visualizations.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to gain insights into the gender pay gap.
